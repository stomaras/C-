            // The book is divided into two parts with first part explaining about the pros and cons of Object Oriented programming and second part 
            // explaining the evolution of 23 classic software design patterns.
            // There are 3 types of Design Patterns
            // 1) Creational 
            // This type deals with the object creation and initialization. This pattern gives the program more flexibility
            // in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
            // Eg: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory ...etc

            // 2) Structural
            // This type deals with class and object composition
            // This pattern focuses on decoupling interface and implementation of classes and its objects.
            // Eg: Adapter, Bridge .. ETC

            // 3) Behavioural
            // This Type deals with the communication between Classes and objects
            // Eg: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter ... etc
