# FLUENT API
  - can be applied when EF builds a model from your domain classes.
  - ou can inject the Fluent API configurations by overriding the OnModelCreating method of DbContext in Entity Framework 6.X
  - You can use modelBuilder, an object of DbModelBuilder class to configur domain classes. 
  - The DbModelBuilder is called Fluent API because you can call different methods in a chain.
