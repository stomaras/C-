            // The book is divided into two parts with first part explaining about the pros and cons of Object Oriented programming and second part 
            // explaining the evolution of 23 classic software design patterns.
            // There are 3 types of Design Patterns
            // 1) Creational 
            // This type deals with the object creation and initialization. This pattern gives the program more flexibility
            // in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
            // Eg: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory ...etc

            // 2) Structural
            // This type deals with class and object composition
            // This pattern focuses on decoupling interface and implementation of classes and its objects.
            // Eg: Adapter, Bridge .. ETC

            // 3) Behavioural
            // This Type deals with the communication between Classes and objects
            // Eg: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter ... etc

            /*
             * Creational Design Patterns provide ways to instantiate a single object or group of related objects. These patterns deal with the process of object creation in such a way that they are seperated from their implementing systwem.
             * That provides more flexibility in deciding which object needs to be created or instantiated for a given scenario.
             * Creational Design Pattern -> 1) Factory Method
             *                              2) Abstract Factory
             *                              3) Builder
             *                              4) Prototype
             *                              5) Singleton
